      \item {
        Led a company-wide transition to AWS SageMaker on more than a dozen
        client accounts, saving \$40,000 annually in infrastructure costs and
        reduced the onboarding time for new analysts from 3 days to 15 minutes.
        (Docker, Terraform, Jenkins)
      }
      \item {
        Principal developer of the internal python + SQL software development
        kit, which optimized the engineering environment installation time from
        45 minutes to ~30 seconds and removed collaboration barriers between
        data scientists, engineers, and project managers. (Presto SQL, jinja, bash,
        make, poetry-python)

    {Data Scientist (Pricing and Marketing)} % Job title

    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
      \item {
          Wrote an optimization algorithm for strategic pricing of consumer
          healthcare products in 11 countries, modeling more than \$5Bn in
          revenue across 8 product categories per country.
          (Python, Numpy, nlopt)
      }
      \item {
          Created ETL pipelines that prepared 1+ TB consumer healthcare
          product sales for a data warehouse.   I also designed over 50 custom
          views in the warehouse that reduced the average data scientist query
          time from 5 minutes to a few seconds and reduced the team's query
          costs by 80 percent. (Spark SQL/pyspark, Kubernetes, Azure)
      }
      % \item {
      %     Optimized MY2021 MSRP recommendations for an international motorcycle
      %     company, identifying opportunities targeting multiple strategic
      %     options - dealer revenue, manufacturer revenue/margin, or market
      %     penetration by motorcycle model. (Databricks, hyperopt)
      % }
      % \item {
      %     Modeled contractor costs for a warehouse trust fund and
      %     deployed the model/report into our client's
      %     infrastructure. (Denodo, Excel, Python)
      % }
      \item {
          Built market-mix models for three clients, solving for product
          recommendations related to optimal pricing, personalization, customer
          churn, and lifetime value (CLTV) for over 1MM program members.  In
          these projects I had the opportunity to benchmark traditional methods
          like survival and mixed-effects modeling against newer, more
          sophisticated techniques, such as using an LSTM to predict
          cross-product purchasing behavior. (python, scipy, R, lmer, numpy)
